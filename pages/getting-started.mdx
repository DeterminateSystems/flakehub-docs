## Install Nix

Use the [Determinate Nix Installer][dni] for a rock solid and fast experience:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

We also have a GitHub action:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  nix-build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Nix
        uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main
      - name: Run `nix build`
        run: nix build .
```
