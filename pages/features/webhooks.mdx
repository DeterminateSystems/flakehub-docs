# Webhooks

<Admonition kind="warning">
Webhooks are currently in beta.
If you're interested in trying them out, [contact support][support].
</Admonition>

**Webhooks** can let your integrations take action in response to releases published on FlakeHub.
They can be associated with any public for unlisted flakes your account has access to.
Optionally, the events may be filtered by a version specifier.
Webhook payloads sent by FlakeHub are signed if you provide a secret in the configuration, with the signature sent in the `X-FlakeHub-Signature-256` header.

## Example webhook configuration [#example-config]

Option | What it does | Example
:------|:-------------|:-------
URL | URL to receive the POSTed webhook event | `https://example.com/webhook`
Flake | The case-insensitive name of the flake to subscribe to | `DeterminateSystems/flake-schemas`
Version specifier | A [SemVer] version specifier event filter | `0.1.*`
Secret | The secret value to [HMAC] sign the message body with | `20f6dadcca4076863536ea852264e1d9105cc429d01f319872225ffe65ea8a92`

## Payload

For every matching release, your webhook receive JSON as a `POST` with a `Content-Type` of `application/json`.
Here's an example JSON payload:

```json
