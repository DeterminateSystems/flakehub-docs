# Flake discovery

FlakeHub provides several ways of discovering flakes that have been published to the platform.

### Search

The FlakeHub UI provides a search bar that enables you to search for flakes using arbitrary search queries, such as "rust" or "nix neovim."
You can activate the search bar using <kbd>&#8984; + K</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd>.

You can also search using the [FlakeHub CLI][cli]'s [`search`][cli-search] command.
Here's an example:

```shell
fh search wayland
```
