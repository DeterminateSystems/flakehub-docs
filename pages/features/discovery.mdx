# Flake discovery

FlakeHub provides several ways of discovering flakes that have been published to the platform.

### Search

The FlakeHub UI provides a search bar that enables you to search for flakes using arbitrary search queries, such as "rust" or "nix neovim."
You can activate the search bar using <kbd>&#8984; + K</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd>.

You can also search using the [FlakeHub CLI][cli]'s [`search`][cli-search] command.
Here's an example:

```shell
fh search wayland
```

### Listing

#### All flakes [#list-flakes]

You can see a listing of all available flakes at [flakehub.com/flakes][all-flakes] or using [`fh`][cli]:

#### All organizations [#list-orgs]

You can see a listing of all public organizations at [flakehub.com/orgs][all-orgs] or using [`fh`][cli]:

#### Releases for a flake [#list-releases]

You can see a listing of all releases of a flake at a URL with this structure:

#### Matching versions [#list-versions]

You can see a listing of all flake versions matching a version constraint using the [`fh`][cli]'s [`list versions`][cli-versions] command:

```
