# The FlakeHub documentation

Welcome to the docs for [**FlakeHub**][flakehub]!
FlakeHub is a [Nix flake][flakes] management platform built by [Determinate Systems][detsys].
It provides support for [Semantic Versioning](#semver) (SemVer) for your organization and a central place to discover flakes.

## Features

FlakeHub brings a variety of new capabilities to the table.

### Semantic versioning [#semver]

[Nix] has no built-in concept of [semantic versioning][semver].

### Flake discovery [#discovery]

FlakeHub provides you with several ways to discover [flakes] published to the platform, including:

* Plaintext [search]
* Lists for:
  * [All flakes][list-flakes]
  * [All orgs][list-orgs]
  * [Flake releases][releases]
  * Flake [versions] matching a [version constraint][semver]

### Webhooks

FlakeHub can send [webhooks]
