# Learn Nix

[Determinate Systems][detsys] has created a learning resourced called [Zero to Nix][z2n] that we recommend as a guide to getting started with Nix.

<HoverableButton title="Zero to Nix" description="Your guide to learning Nix and flakes" link="https://zero-to-nix.com" />

Unlike other learning resources in the [Nix] ecosystem

## Start

The main learning track in Zero to Nix is the [Quick start][start], which includes eight practical tutorials:

1. [Get Nix running on your system][start-1]
1. [Run a program with Nix][start-2]
1. [Explore Nix development environments][start-3]
1. [Build a package using Nix][start-4]
1. [Search for Nix packages][start-5]
1. [Turn your project into a flake][start-6]
1. [Uninstall Nix (if necessary)][start-7]
1. [Learn more][start-8]

## Concepts

Supplementing Zero to Nix's [quick start](#start) are a series of docs covering a variety of core Nix [concepts].
Some of the most important include:

* [Nix], the package manager, build tool, and command-line interface that undergirds [FlakeHub].
* [Flakes], which provides Nix with things like [universal references][flakerefs] and [pinned dependencies][pinning].
* [Nix the language][nixlang], which powers Nix and everything that Nix offers, including [development environments][dev-env], [Nix packages][packages], and the [NixOS] operating system.
* [Nixpkgs], the world's largest collection of Nix code, including [derivations] for over 80,000 packages.
