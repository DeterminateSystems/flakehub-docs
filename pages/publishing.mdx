# Publishing your flakes to FlakeHub

You can publish your flakes to FlakeHub using the [`flakehub-push`][action] GitHub Action.

We recommend using FlakeHub's [flake publishing wizard][wizard] as a quickstart.

## Suggestions for your flake's README

While it's totally up to you what you put in your README...

````markdown
# Use as a flake

[![FlakeHub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://flakehub.com/f/YourOrgName/YourFlakeName/badge)](https://flakehub.com/flake/YourOrgName/YourFlakeName)

Add YourFlakeName to your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.YourFlakeName.url = "https://flakehub.com/f/YourOrgName/YourFlakeName/*.tar.gz";

  outputs = { self, YourFlakeName }: {
    # Use in your outputs
  };
}
```
