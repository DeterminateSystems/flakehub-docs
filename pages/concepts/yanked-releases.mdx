# Yanked releases

On FlakeHub, you can **yank** specific flake [releases].
Yanked releases are:

* Never considered when resolving a flake [version constraint][semver], *even if that release is the only possible match for the version constraint*.
* Still available to users who have that version locked in their [`flake.lock`][lockfile] file.
* Still visible on the website, although the UI clearly indicates that they've been yanked.

You may want to yank a release if, for example, you've published it by mistake or you consider it to have such significant flaws that you want to shield others from using it.

## How to yank flake releases

<Callout>
You can only yank releases for your own flakes or flakes in orgs for which you're an admin.
</Callout>

You can yank releases that you own in the FlakeHub UI by clicking on the cog icon on the panel for a specific release:

<YankButton />

Release panels look like this:

You can see the panels on the releases page for a flake.
Here's the URL structure for releases pages:

<UrlFormat root="https://flakehub.com/flake" segments={[
  "slash",
  { variable: true, name: "org" },
  "slash",
  { variable: true, name: "project" },
  "slash",
  { variable: false, name: "releases" },
]} />

An example would be https://flakehub.com/flake/tailscale/tailscale/releases.
