# Yanked flakes

Releases may be *yanked* from time to time if the release is published by mistake or has been found to have significant flaws.

A yanked release is ever considered when resolving a versions while locking, **even if it is the only possible solution**.
Yanked releases are still available to users who have that version locked in their [`flake.lock`][lockfile].
A yanked release is still visible on the website.

At this time, publishers cannot yank releases on their own. Please contact [support@flakehub.com][support] and we'll get it sorted.
