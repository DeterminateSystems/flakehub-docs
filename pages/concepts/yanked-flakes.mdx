# Yanked flakes

You can *yank* any flake release on FlakeHub if you wish, for example if the release is published by mistake or it's deemed to have significant flaws.
Yanked flakes are:

* Never considered when resolving a flake [version constraint][semver], *even if it's the only possible solution*.
* Still available to users who have that version locked in the [`flake.lock`][lockfile] file.
* Still visible on the website, although the UI clearly indicates that they've been yanked.

At this time, publishers cannot yank releases on their own. Please contact [support@flakehub.com][support] and we'll get it sorted.

[lockfile]: https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/flakes#lockfile
[semver]: ./semver
