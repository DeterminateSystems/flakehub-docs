# How FlakeHub URLs work

Here's the structure of FlakeHub URLs:

<UrlFormat root="https://flakehub.com/f" segments={[
  "slash",
  { variable: true, name: "org" },
  "slash",
  { variable: true, name: "project" },
  "slash",
  { variable: true, name: "version-range" },
  { variable: false, name: ".tar.gz" },
]} />

<ExampleUrls
  examples={[
    { org: "ryantm", repo: "agenix", version: "0.13" },
    { org: "NixOS", repo: "nixpkgs", version: "*" },
    { org: "NixOS", repo: "nixpkgs", version: "~0.2305" },
    { org: "NixOS", repo: "nix", version: "=2.17.0" },
  ]}
/>

The `version-range` field defines the boundaries of versions you want.
The range is not an exact version number, and allows SemVer compatible upgrades.

FlakeHub's version solver behaves like [Cargo's version solver][resolution].
In short, here are some example version ranges and how they're interpreted:

* **1.0.1** is always 1.0.1 and never upgrades to 2.0.0.
* **0.1.1** returns at least 0.1.1 but never upgrades to 0.2.0.

FlakeHub also offers a few comparison operators, which generally shouldn't be necessary.

## Tilde operator (`~`) [#tilde]

The tilde (`~`) reduces the maximum version boundary when specifying the major and minor versions.
The version constraint `~1.0`, for example, upgrades to any version between 1.0 and 1.1 but not to 1.1.

## Wildcard operator (`*`) [#wildcard]

The wildcard (`*`) allows for any version in that position.

* The version range `*` always uses the highest published version.
* `1.2.*` allows any version with the major and minor version 1.2.

## Equals operator (`=`) [#equals]

The equals (`=`) operator enables users to specify exactly one version with no room to update.

* `=1.0` always returns version 1.0.
