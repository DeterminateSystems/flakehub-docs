# How FlakeHub URLs work

Here's the structure of FlakeHub URLs:

<UrlStructure />

<ExampleUrls
  examples={[
    { org: "ryantm", repo: "agenix", version: "0.13" },
    { org: "NixOS", repo: "nixpkgs", version: "*" },
    { org: "NixOS", repo: "nixpkgs", version: "~0.2305" },
    { org: "NixOS", repo: "nix", version: "=2.17.0" },
  ]}
/>

The `version-range` field defines the boundaries of versions you want.
The range is not an exact version number, and allows SemVer compatible upgrades.

FlakeHub's version solver behaves like Cargo's version solver.
In short, here are some example version ranges and how they're interpreted:

* **1.0.1** will always be at least 1.0.1, and will never upgrade to 2.0.0.
* **0.1.1** will get at least 0.1.1 but will never upgrade to 0.2.0.

FlakeHub also offers a few comparison operators, which generally shouldn't be necessary.

## Tilde operator (~)

The tilde reduces the maximum version boundary when specifying the major and minor versions.
For example, ~1.0 upgrades to any version between 1.0 and 1.1 but not to 1.1.

## Wildcard operator (*)

The wildcard allows for any version in that position.

* The version range * will always use the highest published version.
* 1.2.* will allow any version with the major and minor version 1.2.

## Equals operator (=)

The equals operator allows users to specify exactly one version with no room to update.

    =1.0 will always get version 1.0.
