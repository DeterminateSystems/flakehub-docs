# Mirroring flakes

**Mirrored** flakes are uploaded to FlakeHub by FlakeHub, to support the development of FlakeHub and bootstrap an interesting initial collection.
All mirrored flakes are Free and Open Source Software with licenses that permit redistribution.

The original owner of a mirrored flake can take over publishing any time they wish by publishing releases on their own.
FlakeHub is intended for developers to publish their own flakes.
When a previously mirrored flake is published by the original author, mirroring is disabled automatically and further publishing is left up to the author.

To see the full collection of mirrored repositories, see [`flakehub-mirror`][mirror].
