# Flake visibility

[Flakes] on FlakeHub have two visibility modes:

Visibility | Meaning | Suggested when
:----------|:--------|:--------------
[**Public**](#public) | The flake is viewable and usable if you know the URL for the flake and it shows up in search results and on the [flake listing][all-flakes]. | You want to boldly and proudly share your flake with the world.
[**Unlisted**](#unlisted) | The flake is viewable and usable *only* if you know the URL for it. It shows up neither in search results nor on the [flake listing][all-flakes]. | You want the flake to be usable but it's not ready to be public (or perhaps you never want to make it public).

## Public flakes [#public]

**Public** flakes are searchable, listed under the owner on the [Organizations][orgs] page, and are displayed throughout FlakeHub.
Public flakes can be downloaded by anyone without authenticating.

## Unlisted flakes [#unlisted]

**Unlisted** flakes are excluded from search results and general listings.
Just like [public](#public) flakes, unlisted flakes can be downloaded by anyone.
Unlisted flakes can be useful for distributing code through FlakeHub that you're not yet ready to advertise.
