# Flake visibility

[Flakes] on FlakeHub have three visibility modes:

Visibility | Meaning | Suggested when
:----------|:--------|:--------------
**Public** | The flake is viewable and usable if you know the URL for the flake and it shows up in search results and on the [flake listing][all-flakes]. | You want to boldly and proudly share your flake with the world.
**Unlisted** | The flake is viewable and usable *only* if you know the URL for it. It shows up neither in search results nor on the [flake listing][all-flakes]. | You want the flake to be usable but it's not ready to be public (or perhaps you never want to make it public).
**Private** | The flake is viewable and usable solely if you are logged into FlakeHub.
