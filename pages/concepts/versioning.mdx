# Tagged vs. rolling versioning

FlakeHub supports two methods of versioning your flakes: [tagged](#tagged) and [rolling](#rolling).

## Tagged

**Tagged** releases are better suited for projects that follow [SemVer] and have a defined release cadence.
The versioning scheme of tagged flakes is up to the author, as long as it conforms to SemVer.
An example of this kind of flake is the [`fh`][fh] flake.

## Rolling

**Rolling** versions are ideal for projects that see a constant stream of commits and releases.
The versioning scheme of rolling flakes has:

* A SemVer major version of **0**
* A SemVer minor version of **1** (for the NixOS unstable rolling release train)
* A SemVer patch version of the **number of commits** that were on that branch at that time

Here's a visual representation:

<Rolling />

[Nixpkgs] is an example of a flake with rolling versioning.
Release [`0.1.494976`][version], for example represents the 494976th commit within the unstable epoch.

Consult the [Publishing] guide to see how to enable this.
