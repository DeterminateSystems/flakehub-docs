# Frequently asked questions

## How can I update Nix to use FlakeHub?

We at [Determinate Systems][detsys] recommend using Nix **2.18.1** or newer in conjunction with FlakeHub.

You can upgrade Nix using the [`upgrade-nix`][upgrade-nix] command. To upgrade to Nix 2.18.1:

```shell
sudo nix upgrade-nix \
  --nix-store-paths-url https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-2.18.1/fallback-paths.nix
```

Note that `sudo` is necessary.

Some older versions are supported, too.
FlakeHub depends on relatively recent features of Nix.
These versions of Nix are supported:

* Nix **2.13.5** and above
* Nix **2.15.2** and above
* Nix **2.17** and above

Note that Nix 2.14 and Nix 2.16 are *not* supported.

If you're on NixOS, updating to a recent release of NixOS should update Nix automatically.

If you want a transient shell environment with Nix 2.18.1:

```shell
nix shell "github:NixOS/nix/2.18.1"
```

Or using FlakeHub:

```shell
nix shell "https://flakehub.com/f/NixOS/nix/2.18.1.tar.gz"
```
